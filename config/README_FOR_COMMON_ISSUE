Please ignore the line "pretrained_path: weights.pkl" in test.json. 
I used weights.pkl to save/load weights from/into the model.
Don't worry its presense in the config file is useless now, because of the try-except on this file in train.py.
When I finish training on ImageNet, I will upload the file immediately.
